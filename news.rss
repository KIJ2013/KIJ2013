			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We now have over 5000 people registered for KIJ13. We hope to have the on-line booking system available soon so that people can start firming up their plans for the summer of 2013. The system will allow you to make alterations so don&#8217;t worry about booking too few places as you can add people to your Group, Unit, District or Country contingents as we get closer to the event. We have participants from 13 different countries currently stating an interest and look forward to seeing as many of you as possible at our Jamboree.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KIJ is now officially launched.</p>
<p>Over a thousand Leaders from across Kent attended the impressive KIJ stand at this years <em><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Active</span><span style="color: #ff6600;">8</span></strong></em> conference and exhibition, held at the Kent Show Ground, Detling on Sunday 6th March 2011.</p>

<p>Chris Frankland, Media and PR Manager said</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had a fantastic response to our launch today. I did not expect to have queues of people lining up to access our registration pods. The response at times was overwhelming.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on to say</p>
<p>&#8220;I am delighted for all the team here today who have put in so much effort to get us here and the really positive reaction from everyone who we have met and spoken to today on the stand, it has made it all worth while. A big thank you must go out to everyone who has shown their support for KIJ and we look forward from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have not registered interest and would like to be part of KIJ then please access the registration page on this site.</p>
